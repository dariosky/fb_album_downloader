fb_album_downloader
===================

Today I needed to download some images from a Facebook album (thanks Cesko), I don't trust browser extensions for this, so looked for a bookmarklet. Here it is.

### usage

Copy the content of `facebook_download.js` in a bookmark and click on it from a Facebook Album page to get all the images in a savable format.

By default result will be a (big) page with all the original images that you can save easily with your browser.
You could get the link as text or as html link by passing `mode="text"` or `mode = "link"` in the function call.

### todo

Place it in a server and call it remotely.

Francesco Casotto for the great photos I had wanted to download.
